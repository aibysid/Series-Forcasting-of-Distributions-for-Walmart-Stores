# Series-Forcasting-of-Distributions-for-Walmart-Stores

How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this project, in addition to traditional forecasting methods ARIMA and Fourier analysis ,I will  use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.

This project mainly focuses on walmart sales data but same principles can be applied to stores like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra and Other online stores whose profits depends largely on location of inventory and delivery Optimisations. This is project is a part of my Kaggle competetion famously known as M5 Forcasting link - https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy
